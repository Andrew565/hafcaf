# `hafcaf`

_When you only want a little JavaScript in your SPA._

## Introduction

`hafcaf` is an extremely minimal single-page application (SPA)framework, designed for people who want to rapidly create apps without having to learn a whole new way to create apps. If you know HTML and can follow a tiny bit of instruction, you can be creating a SPA in less than five minutes.

* No build tools needed - but you can integrate with them if you wish.
* Works as far back as IE 8.
* Designed to require the use of as little JavaScript as possible.
* Will play nice with pretty much all CSS frameworks (not tested, but hafcaf is designed to leave styling decisions up to you).

`hafcaf` is heavily inspired by [this article by Heydon Pickering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/reimagining-single-page-applications-progressive-enhancement/), and until I get another free evening to make my own article about it, you can read that article to figure out what's going on here. ;)

## Installation

Take the HTML, CSS, and JS files provided here and stick them in a folder (ZIP files and/or `npm install` coming soon). Replace the content of the HTML file as desired, style with CSS as desired, augment with JS *only if you really, really want to*.

## Licensing

The Unlicense, but if you mention me that'd be nice.

## Contributing

I'll gladly accept questions, comments, suggestions, and pull requests.
